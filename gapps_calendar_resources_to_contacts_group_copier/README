A script that copies select Calendar Resources as contacts under a set group
for selected organization's members.

Depends on the gdata module. To install:
$ sudo pip install gdata

To run the script:
$ python gapps_calendar_resources_to_contacts_group_copier.py -U <user>

For help:
$ python gapps_calendar_resources_to_contacts_group_copier.py --help

Default parameters can be set in config.conf, or any file specified with
--config FILE.
cp config.conf.template config.conf

This script requires a domain token, that is read from token_domain.conf or
any file specfied with --domain-token FILE.

This script requires Calendar Resource API OAuth2 authorization from a domain
administrator.
If you have not authorized the script before, it will need to
interactively obtain an authorization token during the initial run. The
script will save the authorization token in the file "token.conf", or any
file specified with --token FILE.
After the initial run, the script will not need interactive authorization on
subsequent runs. However, to force re-authorization, use --reauthorize.

To treat the need for user authorization as a failure (e.g. to prevent a cron
script from hanging), use --batch.
